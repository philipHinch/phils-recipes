# Phil's Recipes

This is my very first **React** project and is a remake of my Vanilla JavaScript [My Foods App](https://github.com/philipHinch/my-foods-app).

Here you can search your favourite meals and filter them by category. 

When clicking on a meal, a modal will pop up with all the detailed info about that meal.

The recipes are fetched from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) API.
